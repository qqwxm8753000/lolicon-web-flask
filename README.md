# Welcome to the NSFW Image Download Flask Project

## Description

This project is a Flask application that allows users to download images from a specified source. It uses the `requests` library for handling HTTP requests and `Flask` for serving the web interface.

## Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Prepare the Environment

First, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this using pip. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install requests flask
```

### 2. Download the Source Code

Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lolicon-web-flask.git
```

### 3. Run the Application

Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the source code and run the application using:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Access the Application

Open your web browser and enter the following URL:

```
http://<your-ip>:5000
```

Replace `<your-ip>` with the IP address of the machine where the Flask application is running. This will bring up the web interface of the application.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
- The application runs on port 5000 by default. If you need to change the port, you can modify the `app.run()` command in `app.py`.
- For additional configurations or customizations, refer to the code comments and documentation within the source files.
